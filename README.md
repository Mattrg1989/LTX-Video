## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What are diffusion models?

Diffusion models are a class of generative models that learn to create data by simulating a diffusion process. They have shown great promise in generating high-quality images and videos.

### How does image-to-video generation work?

Image-to-video generation uses algorithms to animate static images. The model learns patterns and movements from existing video data to create dynamic sequences.

### Can I use my own datasets?

Yes, you can train the model on your own datasets. Ensure that your data is properly formatted and follows the guidelines provided in the documentation.

### What are the system requirements?

LTX-Video requires Python 3.7 or higher and a machine with a capable GPU for optimal performance. Check the `requirements.txt` for additional dependencies.

### How can I report issues?

If you encounter any issues, please open an issue in the repository. Provide a detailed description of the problem and any relevant logs.
